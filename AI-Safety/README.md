    - We do not know how to train systems to robustly behave well
    - We are most optimistic about a multi-faceted, empirically-driven approach to AI safety
      - In our AI safety research, empirical evidence about AI – though it mostly arises from computational experiments, i.e. AI training and evaluation – is the primary source of ground truth.
